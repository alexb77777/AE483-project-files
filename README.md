# AE483-project-files
GitHub Repository for the AE-483 Final Project

The files in this repository include ```controller_ae483.c```, the controller used for the project, written in c code. Additionally, there are flight files for each of the 4 paths attempted. ```ml01_path.py``` is the flight file for the first milestone. ```ml02_path.py``` is the flight file for the second milestone. ```ml03_path_01.py``` is the flight file for the first path of the third milestone. The first path follows a stereotypical lawnmower pattern.  ```ml03_path_02.py``` is the flight file for the second path of the third milestone. This flight path follows a tapered L-shape, where each pass gets shorter and shorter. Finally, ```01-project.ipynb``` is the notebook file that processes all of the data and makes the plots.
